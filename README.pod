=head1 Modified Network Diagnostic Tool

=head2 SUMMARY

This is a modified version of the Network Diagnostic Tool version 3.6.4.

Some of the differences from the stock 3.6.4 applet:

=over

=item Liveconnect

Additional methods to make the Java/JavaScript communication easier, especially in the case where one desires to do many measurements one after the other.

=item Results

A method to get the full measurement result, including all the web100_* parameters, in a JSON structure.

=item Interface

Aesthetic changes that make the applet more appealing to the casual user. Traditional interface still available.

=item IPv6

Some work towards IPv6 and AAAA records handling.

=item Results submission

The applet can also submit measurement results by opening a TCP connection itself to a report gathering server. This functionality has been superseded by the Java/JavaScript communication method, but is still available in the code.
