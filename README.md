This is a modified version of the Network Diagnostic Tool version 3.6.4.

Some of the differences from the stock 3.6.4 applet:

-Additional methods to make the Java/JavaScript communication easier, especially in the case where one desires to do many measurements one after the other.
-A method to get the full measurement result, including all the web100_* parameters, in a JSON structure.
-Aesthetic changes that make the applet more appealing to the casual user. Traditional interface still available.
-Some work towards IPv6 and AAAA records handling.
-The applet can also submit measurement results by opening a TCP connection itself to a report gathering server. This functionality has been superseded by the Java/JavaScript communication method, but is still available in the code.
